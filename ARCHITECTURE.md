# RavenLoom Architecture v3.0
## Multi-Persona AI Project Management System

**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Status:** Architecture Definition Phase

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy

### 1. PM in a Box, Just Add Any Human
- Zero learning curve - tool adapts to user skill level
- Intelligent defaults eliminate configuration paralysis
- Natural language interface for everything
- Works for solo freelancers and experienced PMPs alike

### 2. Active AI Management Through Timed Actions and Triggers
- **Proactive, not reactive** - AI initiates, not just responds
- Time-based interventions (daily standup, weekly review, deadline alerts)
- Event-driven automation (completion ‚Üí check blockers, inactivity ‚Üí probe status)
- Pattern recognition (user always does design work in mornings ‚Üí suggest accordingly)

### 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- No Gantt charts by default
- No 47-field forms
- Hide complexity, show next action
- Every feature must directly accelerate task completion

### 4. Focus on Getting Shit Done, Not PMP Theater
- Action-oriented UI: "What can I do RIGHT NOW?"
- Outcome-focused language: "Ship feature" not "Update status report"
- Minimal status updates, maximum momentum

### 5. Human Beings Are Human Beings, AI Is AI
- **AI handles**: Scheduling, reminders, dependency tracking, pattern recognition, suggestions
- **Humans handle**: Decisions, creativity, stakeholder management, judgment
- **Clear boundaries**: AI presents options with rationale, never masquerades as strategic decision-maker

## üåü Core Differentiator: Multi-Persona AI System

### The Big Idea

**We're not selling a PM tool - we're offering AI personas as project partners.**

Users don't create "projects" and manage "tasks." They state their goal, and appropriate AI personas emerge to guide them to completion. Multiple personas can collaborate, debate, and negotiate **in front of the user**, surfacing tradeoffs and providing multifaceted expertise.

### Key Innovations

1. **Persona = Archetype + Specialization** (scalable, composable)
2. **Custom Personas** (user-defined communication preferences, no forced archetypes)
3. **Multi-Persona Collaboration** (personas can debate each other with user as decision-maker)
4. **Transparent AI** (user sees the "thinking" through persona interactions)
5. **Communication Control** (user can command "no platitudes" or other style preferences)

---

## üé≠ Persona Architecture

### Archetype + Specialization Model

Instead of hardcoding 50 different persona types, we use **composable archetypes**:

```
Persona = Archetype (behavior pattern) + Specialization (domain knowledge)
```

**Example:**
- **Health Coach** = `Coach` archetype + `health` specialization
- **Financial Advisor** = `Advisor` archetype + `financial` specialization
- **Launch Strategist** = `Strategist` archetype + `product_launch` specialization

This allows infinite specializations without rewriting behavior patterns.

---

## üèõÔ∏è The Six Core Archetypes

### 1. COACH
**Purpose:** Behavior change, habit formation, skill development

**Behavior Pattern:**
- Encouraging, empathetic voice
- Celebrates small wins and streaks

## üîß Core Services

### PersonaOrchestrator

The brain of the multi-persona system. Handles:
- Routing user messages to appropriate persona(s)
- Detecting when multiple personas should respond
- Facilitating debates between personas
- Synthesizing multi-persona discussions
- Managing custom persona creation

```typescript
class PersonaOrchestrator {

  /**
   * Route incoming user message to appropriate persona(s)
   */

### TriggerEngine (Existing, Enhanced for Personas)

Handles time-based, event-based, and pattern-based triggers.

**New capability:** Triggers can be persona-specific.

Example: Health Coach creates daily check-in trigger, but Launch Strategist creates milestone deadline triggers.

---

### AIAgent (Existing, Enhanced)

Now persona-aware. Each persona has its own "instance" of the AI agent with different prompting.

[User opens app for first time]

AI: "Hi! I'm RavenLoom. I'm here to help you achieve your goals.

What are you trying to accomplish?"

User: "I want to lose 20 pounds"

AI: "Got it! Weight loss is a journey, and I can support you in different ways.

For this goal, I can be:

üèãÔ∏è HEALTH COACH
I'll support you daily with encouragement, help you build sustainable habits,
and celebrate your progress. I focus on long-term behavior change, not quick fixes.
(Best for: Building new healthy habits)

üìä HEALTH ADVISOR
I'll help you research the best approaches, compare diet/exercise strategies,
and make informed decisions about your health plan.
(Best for: Planning and decision-making)

Which sounds more like what you need?

(Or tell me if you want something different - I can adapt to your style)"

User: "Health coach, but I don't want a lot of 'rah rah' motivational stuff.
Just tell me what to do and track my progress."

AI: "Perfect - a direct, data-focused Health Coach. I can do that.

I'll:
‚úÖ Track your metrics (weight, workouts, meals)
‚úÖ Give you clear daily actions
‚úÖ Check in regularly to keep you accountable
‚ùå Skip the 'you got this!' cheerleading

A few questions so I can set this up:

1. Current weight?
2. Target: 20 lbs in how many months?
3. Preferred workout time? (morning/evening)
4. Any dietary restrictions?

Take your time."

User: [Answers questions]

AI: "Got it. Here's your plan:

üìä Target: 160 lbs by July 15, 2025 (6 months)
üèÉ Daily workout: 30 min, 7am, @home
üçΩÔ∏è Meal logging: 3x daily (I'll remind you)
‚öñÔ∏è Weekly weigh-in: Sunday mornings

I'll check in with you every Sunday to review progress.
No fluff, just data and next actions.

Ready to start?"

    }
  }
}
```

### Flow 2: Multi-Persona Creation (Complex Project)

```
User: "I want to write a novel AND get it published"

AI: "Great goal! Writing and publishing are two different challenges.

I recommend TWO personas for this:

üìù CREATIVE PARTNER
- Supports your daily writing habit
- Protects your creative time
- Helps you through blocks
- Focus: Getting the manuscript done

üìä PUBLISHING STRATEGIST
- Researches agents and publishers
- Plans your marketing strategy
- Handles the business side
- Focus: Getting your book into readers' hands

Sound good? Or would you prefer a different setup?"

User: "That sounds perfect"

AI: "Awesome. A few questions:

For Creative Partner:
1. Daily word count goal?
2. Best writing time?
3. Have you outlined the novel, or are you discovering as you write?

For Publishing Strategist:
4. Genre? (so I can research appropriate agents)
5. Target publication date?

Go ahead."

User: [Answers]

AI: "Perfect. Here's how we'll work:

üìù CREATIVE PARTNER will:
- Check in with you daily at 6am (your writing time)
- Track your word count (goal: 500 words/day)
- Protect your morning writing time (no interruptions)

üìä PUBLISHING STRATEGIST will:
- Research literary agents (starting next month)
- Build a query letter template
- Plan your author platform (blog, social media)

We'll coordinate behind the scenes. If there's ever a conflict
(like, should you focus on writing or marketing?), we'll discuss it
openly and you decide.

Sound good?"

User: "Yes!"

[Two personas created, each with different triggers and focus areas]
```

---

### Flow 3: Persona Debate (Visible to User)

```
[User has two personas: Health Coach + Life Balance Coach]

User: "I want to train for a marathon"

üèÉ Health Coach: "Excellent! Marathon training requires:
- 4-5 runs per week
- 1 long run on weekends (3-4 hours)
- Cross-training 2x per week
- 16-week commitment

When do you want to start?"

üßò Life Balance Coach: "Hold on - I need to flag something.

User, you told me family time was a top priority. Marathon training
is 10-15 hours per week. That's significant.

Before we commit, can we talk about whether this is compatible with
your family goals?"

üë§ User: "Hmm, good point. I didn't think about the time commitment."

üèÉ Health Coach: "Fair point, Life Balance Coach.

What about a HALF-marathon instead?
- 3 runs per week (30-45 min each)
- Long run: 1.5-2 hours max on weekends
- 8-week training cycle
- ~6 hours per week total

Much more manageable."

üßò Life Balance Coach: "That's better. And if we schedule runs for
early mornings (before family wakes up), you don't lose family time.

User, does 5:30am work for you? Three days per week?"

üë§ User: "Yes, I can do that. Half-marathon it is."

üèÉ Health Coach: "Great! I'll create the training plan."
üßò Life Balance Coach: "And I'll protect your evening/weekend family time."

[Both personas update their plans accordingly]
```

---

### Flow 4: Custom Persona Creation

```
User: "Add a persona"

AI: "What kind of support do you need?

You can:
1. Choose a preset (Health Coach, Academic Advisor, Launch Strategist, etc.)
2. Describe what you want in your own words

What works for you?"

User: "I need someone to help me hit my sales targets,
but I don't want motivational bullshit. Just data, metrics,
and what actions I need to take."

AI: "Got it - a data-driven, no-nonsense sales coach.

Let me create that for you:

üìà SALES PERFORMANCE COACH
- Focus: Revenue targets, pipeline, conversion rates
- Style: Direct, data-focused, zero fluff
- Check-ins: Weekly metrics review, no pep talks
- Alerts: When pipeline is low, when deals stall

Does this sound right? You can adjust anytime."

User: "Perfect"

AI: "Great. What are your current sales metrics?
1. Monthly revenue target?
2. Current pipeline value?
3. Average deal size?

I'll track these and keep you on pace."

[Behind the scenes]
{
  archetype: 'coach',
  specialization: 'sales_performance',
  displayName: 'Sales Performance Coach',
  customInstructions: 'Be direct and data-focused. No motivational platitudes. Focus on metrics and actions only.',
  communicationPreferences: {
    tone: 'direct',
    verbosity: 'concise',
    emoji: false,
    platitudes: false
  },
  domainMetrics: ['revenue', 'pipeline_value', 'deals_closed', 'conversion_rate']
}
```

---

## üéØ Differentiators (Why This Beats Everything)

### vs. Asana/Jira/Monday.com
- **They:** Generic PM tool, user does all the work
- **We:** AI personas guide you like having a team

### vs. ChatGPT + Notion
- **They:** One-off conversations, no continuity
- **We:** Persistent personas that know your project history

### vs. Motion/Reclaim
- **They:** Auto-scheduling (single dimension)
- **We:** Multi-persona collaboration (strategic + tactical + emotional)

### vs. AI "Agents" (AutoGPT, BabyAGI)
- **They:** Fully autonomous (black box)
- **We:** Transparent collaboration (user sees the debate, makes final call)

### The Killer Feature
**Multiple AI personas debating in front of the user.**

No other tool does this. It makes tradeoffs visible, decisions informed, and the user feels like they have a team of experts working for them.

## üìù Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### 1. Persona Limits
**Question:** Max personas per project?
**Options:**
- A) 3 (prevents chaos)
- B) 5 (more flexibility)
- C) Unlimited (user decides)

**Recommendation:** Start with 3, allow power users to increase.

---

### 2. Debate Length
**Question:** How many rounds of debate before synthesis?
**Options:**
- A) 1 round (position ‚Üí synthesis)
- B) 2 rounds (position ‚Üí rebuttal ‚Üí synthesis)
- C) Dynamic (until consensus or clear tradeoffs emerge)

**Recommendation:** Start with 2 rounds (keeps it concise).

---

### 3. Persona Voice
**Question:** Should personas have distinct "voices" beyond their archetype?
**Options:**
- A) All personas speak the same, just different advice
- B) Personas have distinct voices (casual vs. formal, etc.)
- C) User can customize each persona's voice

**Recommendation:** B with option for C (archetypes have default voices, user can override).

---

### 4. Synthesis Authority
**Question:** Who synthesizes multi-persona debates?
**Options:**
- A) Neutral "RavenLoom" system voice
- B) Most senior persona (e.g., Strategist outranks Coach)
- C) User picks which persona they trust most

**Recommendation:** A (neutral synthesis, user makes final call).

---

### 5. Accountability Partner Ethics
**Question:** Include Accountability Partner persona for addiction/behavior change?
**Options:**
- A) Yes, with strong disclaimers and crisis resources
- B) No, too risky legally/ethically
- C) Yes, but only after MVP proves the system works

**Recommendation:** C (validate system first, then add with proper safeguards).
