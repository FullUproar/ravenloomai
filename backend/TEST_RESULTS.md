- Sending user message to AI persona
- AI persona generating contextual response
- Message threading and storage
- GraphQL mutation: `sendMessage`

**User Message:**
> "Hi! I just started this project and I'm feeling motivated. What should I focus on first?"

**AI Persona Response (Health Coach):**
> "Welcome! It's great that you're feeling motivated to start this project. Let's begin by focusing on two key areas: nutrition and physical activity.
>
> For nutrition, start by tracking what you typically eat in a day. This will give us a baseline to understand what changes might be beneficial.
>
> For physical activity, aim to incorporate some form of exercise into your daily routine. This could be a brisk walk, a gym session, or even a dance class - whatever you enjoy and can maintain consistently.
>
> Remember, the goal here is to make sustainable changes, not to achieve perfection overnight. Let's focus on making small, manageable changes that you can build on over time. How does that sound?"

**Observations:**
- Response tone is direct (respects communication preference)
- No excessive motivational platitudes (respects preference)
- Focuses on actionable advice (Coach archetype behavior)
- Demonstrates domain knowledge (nutrition, exercise)

### Test 4: Conversation History Retrieval

- Message ordering and metadata
- GraphQL query: `getConversation`

**Result:**
- Retrieved 2 messages (user + persona)
- Messages in correct chronological order
- Proper sender identification (user vs persona)
- All metadata present (senderName, senderType, createdAt)

### Test 5: Task Creation with GTD Fields
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**What was tested:**
- Creating tasks with GTD (Getting Things Done) properties
- Task metadata (context, energy level, time estimate)
- GraphQL mutation: `createTask`

**Task Created:**
```json
{
  "id": "20",
  "title": "Track daily calories for one week",
  "description": "Use MyFitnessPal to log all meals and snacks",
  "gtdType": "next_action",
  "context": "@home",
  "energyLevel": "low",
  "timeEstimate": 10,
  "status": "not_started"
}
```

**GTD Fields Validated:**
- ✅ GTD Type: `next_action` (vs waiting_for, someday_maybe, reference)
- ✅ Context: `@home` (location-based task grouping)
- ✅ Energy Level: `low` (effort required)
- ✅ Time Estimate: 10 minutes

### Test 6: Project Query with Relationships
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**What was tested:**
- Fetching project with nested persona data
- Fetching project with nested task data
- GraphQL query: `getProject`

**Result:**
```
Project: Lose 20 pounds
Outcome: Reach 180 lbs and maintain for 2 weeks
Persona: Health Coach (coach + health specialization)
Tasks: 1 task
```
