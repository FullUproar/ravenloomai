# RavenLoom Productivity Lifecycle

## Vision
Guide users from vague idea → concrete plan → consistent execution → victorious completion

---

## Stage 1: ARRIVAL & GOAL CLARITY (0-5 minutes)

### Current State
❌ User lands on empty project list
❌ Creates project with title/description only
❌ No guided goal clarification

### Ideal Experience
✅ **Welcome conversation**
- "What brings you to RavenLoom today?"
- "Tell me about what you want to achieve"
- AI helps clarify vague ideas into concrete goals

✅ **Goal framing questions**
- "Why is this important to you?"
- "What does success look like?"
- "When do you want to achieve this by?"

✅ **Project archetype selection**
- One-time completion (launch a product)
- Habit formation (write daily)
- Ongoing process (manage a business)

### Implementation Needed
- [ ] Onboarding conversation flow
- [ ] Goal clarification prompts in AI
- [ ] Project setup wizard
- [ ] "Why" capture and display

---

## Stage 2: PLANNING & BREAKDOWN (5-15 minutes)

### Current State
⚠️ User can chat about project
⚠️ AI creates tasks when mentioned
❌ No structured planning session
❌ No milestone framework

### Ideal Experience
✅ **Strategic planning conversation**
- "Let's break this down. What are the major milestones?"
- "What's the first thing you need to figure out?"
- "What resources do you need?"
- "What could block you?"

✅ **Adaptive planning based on project type**
- Product launch: MVP → Beta → Launch sequence
- Habit: Daily structure, streak tracking, fallback plans
- Process: Recurring workflows, optimization points

✅ **Visual roadmap generation**
- Clear milestones with dates
- Dependencies and sequencing
- First 3 concrete next actions

### Implementation Needed
- [ ] Planning session workflow
- [ ] Milestone creation and visualization
- [ ] Smart task sequencing
- [ ] Resource/blocker identification prompts

---

## Stage 3: EXECUTION & MOMENTUM (Days/Weeks)

### Current State
❌ Fully reactive - only responds when user initiates
❌ No proactive check-ins
❌ No pattern recognition
❌ No intervention when user stalls

### Ideal Experience
✅ **Proactive accountability**
- "Hey! Haven't seen you in 2 days. Everything okay?"
- "You said you'd work on X today - ready to start?"
- "Quick check-in: How's the testing going?"

✅ **Pattern recognition & intervention**
- "I notice you've rescheduled this task 3 times. What's making it hard?"
- "You're crushing mornings but struggle after lunch. Let's adjust your schedule."
- "You haven't worked on your product in a week but mentioned it's important. Want to talk about what's blocking you?"

✅ **Smart session suggestions**
- "You have 30 min before your meeting - perfect for a quick task"
- "Based on your pattern, you're most productive at 9am. Should I remind you to start your session then?"

✅ **Blocker detection**
- Monitors for frustration, repetitive questions, stuck patterns
- Proactively offers help: "Seems like you're stuck on authentication. Want me to help you break it down?"

### Implementation Needed
- [ ] Activity monitoring system
- [ ] Proactive notification triggers
- [ ] Pattern analysis (work times, completion rates, blockers)
- [ ] Smart intervention system
- [ ] Context-aware session recommendations

---

## Stage 4: COMPLETION & VICTORY (Project end)

### Current State
❌ No completion ceremony
❌ No reflection process
❌ No celebration
❌ Tasks just... end

### Ideal Experience
✅ **Completion detection**
- Recognizes when final milestone is hit
- "🎉 You did it! Your product is launched. That's huge!"

✅ **Reflection conversation**
- "What was the hardest part?"
- "What did you learn?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"
- "How do you feel now that it's done?"

✅ **Success visualization**
- Show progress over time
- Highlight key achievements
- Display streak/consistency metrics (for habits)

✅ **Next chapter**
- "What's next for you?"
- "Want to start a new project?"
- "Should we set up a maintenance phase?"

### Implementation Needed
- [ ] Completion detection logic
- [ ] Reflection conversation flow
- [ ] Success metrics visualization
- [ ] Celebration UI/animations
- [ ] Next project suggestions

## Lifecycle Test Scenarios

### Test 1: New User → First Project Launch
1. User creates account
2. AI asks: "What brings you here?"
3. User: "I want to launch a SaaS product"
4. AI helps clarify goal, timeline, milestones
5. Creates structured plan with first actions
6. User completes first task
7. AI proactively checks in next day
8. User hits blocker, AI detects frustration
9. AI helps overcome blocker
10. User completes project
11. AI celebrates, asks for reflection
12. Suggests next project

### Test 2: Returning User → Habit Formation
1. User wants to "code daily for 30 days"
2. AI helps set up daily structure
3. Day 1: User completes session, AI celebrates
4. Day 2-5: Building streak, AI encourages
5. Day 6: User misses, AI doesn't shame

3. User: "I don't know where to start"
4. AI helps prioritize, breaks down next step
5. User starts small session
6. Builds momentum again
