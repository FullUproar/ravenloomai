```

## User Flow

### 1. Create Project
```
User describes goal in natural language
  â†“
Backend sends goal to GPT-4 with archetype descriptions
  â†“
GPT-4 suggests best archetype + specialization
  â†“
PersonaFactory creates persona with user preferences
  â†“
Project + Persona created and linked
```

### 2. Chat with Persona
```
User sends message
  â†“
ConversationService loads context (project, persona, history)
  â†“
PersonaPromptBuilder creates persona-specific system prompt
  â†“
GPT-4 generates response in persona's voice
  â†“
Message stored and returned to user
```

### 3. Complete Tasks
```
Persona suggests tasks in conversation
  â†“
User or AI creates task with GTD properties
  â†“
Tasks appear in sidebar filtered by context
  â†“
User checks off tasks â†’ AI responds to progress
```

## Example Conversation

**User:** "I want to lose 20 pounds by eating healthier and exercising regularly."

**AI Response:** Creates Health Coach persona (Coach + Health specialization)

**Chat:**
```
User: What should I focus on first?

Health Coach: Start by tracking your daily calories for one week.
This will give us a baseline. Also, aim for 30 minutes of
activity 3x per week. What type of exercise do you enjoy?

User: I like walking and swimming.

Health Coach: Perfect! Let's create some tasks:
- Track calories daily (use MyFitnessPal)
- Walk 30 min on M/W/F
- Swim 30 min on T/Th

Which would you like to start with?
```

## Testing the MVP

### Test Case 1: Weight Loss
1. Create project: "I want to lose 20 pounds"
2. AI should select: **Health Coach** (Coach + Health)
3. Chat about nutrition and exercise
4. Complete suggested tasks

### Test Case 2: Build a Product
1. Create project: "I want to launch a SaaS product"
2. AI should select: **Product Strategist** (Strategist + Product)
3. Chat about MVP, features, go-to-market
4. Complete business tasks

### Test Case 3: Learn Programming
1. Create project: "I want to learn React and build projects"
2. AI should select: **Learning Partner** (Partner + Learning)
3. Chat about curriculum and practice
4. Complete coding tasks

## Environment Variables

Make sure both backend and frontend have access to:

```env
# Backend (.env in /backend)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Frontend (uses backend automatically)
# No additional vars needed for local dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is set
- Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check port 4013 is available

### Frontend won't connect
- Check backend is running on port 4013
- Check Apollo Client URI in `frontend/src/main.jsx`
- Open browser console for GraphQL errors

### AI responses not working
- Check OpenAI API key is valid
- Check API usage limits
- Look for errors in backend console

### Tasks not showing
- Check GraphQL query in browser DevTools
- Verify project has persona created
- Check backend resolvers for errors

## Next Steps

### Enhancements to Try
1. **Add Task Creation from Chat**
   - Parse AI responses for task suggestions
   - Add "Create Task" button on suggestions

2. **Project Progress Visualization**
   - Show completion percentage
   - Add streak tracking for habits

3. **Better Mobile Support**
   - Collapsible task sidebar
   - Touch-friendly interactions

4. **Notification System**
   - Desktop notifications for AI responses
   - Task due date reminders

5. **Multi-Persona (Phase 2)**
   - Allow multiple personas per project
   - Enable persona debates

## Architecture Highlights

### Why This Stack?
- **GraphQL** - Flexible queries, type-safe
- **PostgreSQL** - Reliable, supports JSONB for flexibility
- **React** - Component-based, great ecosystem
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Best-in-class language model
- **Firebase Auth** - Easy authentication
- **Vite** - Fast dev server and builds

### Design Decisions
1. **Chat-First** - Main interaction is natural language
2. **Single Persona MVP** - Simpler to start, expandable later
3. **GTD Methodology** - Proven system for task management
4. **Dark Theme** - Reduces eye strain, looks professional
5. **Polling vs WebSockets** - Simpler to implement, good enough for MVP
